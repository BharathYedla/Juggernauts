Hackathon Environment Setup Documentation
1. Introduction
This documentation will guide you through the environment setup for the hackathon project. The goal of this project is to build a Player Performance Prediction Model using player data and key performance indicators (KPIs). This environment setup is intended for both backend and data science operations, with libraries and tools optimized for data processing, machine learning, and web deployment.
 
2. Prerequisites
Before you start setting up the environment, make sure you have the following installed:
•	Python 3.8+: Python is the primary programming language for the project.
•	Git: For cloning the project repository and version control.
•	IDE (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm): Recommended for code development.
•	Jupyter Notebook (optional): If you're working with data analysis or machine learning models interactively.
•	An API Key: Required for OpenAI models (if you are using GPT, for example).
 
3. Setting Up the Environment
Follow the steps below to set up your local development environment.
Step 1: Install Python
Ensure Python 3.8 or later is installed. You can check the version by running:
bash
Copy code
python --version
If Python is not installed, you can download and install it from the official Python website.
Step 2: Set up a Virtual Environment
Using a virtual environment helps isolate dependencies and ensures that your project doesn't conflict with other Python projects on your machine. To set up a virtual environment:
1.	Create a directory for your project, if you haven't already.
2.	Open the terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to your project folder.
3.	Run the following command to create a virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
4.	Activate the virtual environment:
o	On Windows:
bash
Copy code
.\venv\Scripts\activate
o	On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Once activated, your terminal should show the virtual environment name in parentheses.
Step 3: Install Required Libraries
The project uses several Python libraries, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, flask, and others. To install them, you should create a requirements.txt file containing all the dependencies.
Example requirements.txt:
Copy code
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
sklearn
flask
requests
openai
scipy
Run the following command to install all dependencies listed in the requirements.txt:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 4: Clone the Project Repository
To work on the project, you'll need to clone the hackathon repository from GitHub (or any other version control system you're using). Run the following command:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hackathon-repo.git
Navigate to the cloned repository folder:
bash
Copy code
cd hackathon-repo
Step 5: Configure API Keys and Environment Variables
For some functionalities (such as accessing OpenAI models or any third-party services), you'll need to configure API keys.
1.	Create a .env file in the root of your project folder.
2.	Add the required keys and secrets in the .env file (ensure you don't share this file publicly).
Example .env file:
makefile
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
You can load these environment variables in Python using the python-dotenv library. To install it, run:
bash
Copy code
pip install python-dotenv
Then, load the environment variables in your Python code like this:
python
Copy code
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

# Access your API key
openai_api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
 
4. Running the Project
Once the environment is set up and the dependencies are installed, you can run the project. Depending on your project structure, this may involve:
•	Running a Flask server for the web interface:
bash
Copy code
python app.py
•	Running a Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and model building:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
•	Running any Python script for specific functionalities.
 
5. Testing the Setup
Ensure that everything is working correctly by running some basic tests:
1.	Check if the Flask server is running: Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser. You should see the application running.
2.	Test the prediction model: Input sample data and check if the prediction model works correctly by running the respective script or interacting with the web interface.
 
6. Troubleshooting
Here are some common issues and solutions:
•	Issue: Unable to activate virtual environment.
o	Solution: Ensure you're running the correct activation command depending on your OS.
•	Issue: Missing library dependencies.
o	Solution: Run pip install -r requirements.txt to ensure all libraries are installed.
•	Issue: API key not found.
o	Solution: Make sure the .env file is correctly configured and the environment variables are loaded.
•	Issue: Flask app not running.
o	Solution: Check for any syntax errors in the app.py file and ensure the Flask library is installed.
 
7. Conclusion
By following this setup guide, you'll have the hackathon environment running locally, ready for use. Feel free to modify the environment setup or configuration based on your specific use case.
Good luck with your hackathon project!
